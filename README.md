# Google Genomics Pipelines Tools
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/googlegenomics/pipelines-tools.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/googlegenomics/pipelines-tools)

This repository contains various tools that are useful when running pipelines
with the [Google Genomics API][1]. 

# Quick Start Using Cloud Shell

1. Enable the Genomics API and the Compute Engine API in a new or existing
Google Cloud project.
2. Start a [Cloud Shell][cloud-shell] inside your project.
3. Inside the Cloud Shell, run the command

        go get github.com/googlegenomics/pipelines-tools/...

   This command downloads and installs the pipelines tools.  Note that to build
   these tools outside the Cloud Shell you will need the [Go][2] tool chain.

4. Make a bucket on GCS to store the output from the pipeline:

        export BUCKET=gs://${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}-pipelines
        gsutil mb ${BUCKET}

5. Put some test data into the bucket:

        echo "Hello World" | gsutil cp - ${BUCKET}/input

6. Make a pipeline script that computes the SHA1 sum of a file:

        echo 'sha1sum ${INPUT0} > ${OUTPUT0}' > sha1.script

7. Run the script using the pipelines API:

        pipelines run --inputs=${BUCKET}/input --outputs=${BUCKET}/output sha1.script

8. Check the generated output file:

        gsutil cat ${BUCKET}/output

That's it: you've run your first pipeline.  For more information about the
input formats supported by the pipelines tool, check out the [source code][3].
To learn more about the Pipelines API, consult the [reference
documentation][api-reference].

# Usage

## The `pipelines` tool

This tool provides support for running, cancelling and inspecting pipelines.

As a simple example, to run a pipeline that prints 'hello world':

```
$ cat <<EOF > hello.script
echo "hello world"
EOF
$ pipelines --project=my-project run hello.script --output=gs://my-bucket/logs --wait
```

After the pipeline finishes, you can inspect the output using `gsutil`:

```
$ gsutil cat gs://my-bucket/logs/output
```

The script file format is described in the [source code for the command][3].

## The `migrate-pipeline` tool

This tool takes a JSON encoded v1alpha2 run pipeline request and attempts to
emit a v2alpha1 request that replicates the same behaviour.

For example, given a file `v1.jsonpb` that has a request containing a v1alpha2
ephemeral pipeline and arguments, running:

```
$ migrate-pipeline < v1.jsonpb
```

will produce a v2alpha1 request that performs the same action on standard
output.
